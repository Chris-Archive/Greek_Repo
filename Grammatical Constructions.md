## Infinitive

### Articular Infinitive
The articular infinitive is when the article is used with an infinitive (τό, τοῦ, τῷ, τό). In the nominative and accusative, the infinitive tends to drop the article. The article cannot be dropped in the genitive or the dative. The meaning corresponds to its declension or prepositional form.

- In the nominative, the meaning is the same as the participle.
  - Τὸ Πνεῦμα τοῦ Πατρὸς <u>(τὸ) ἐκπορεύεσθαι</u>.
    - The Spirit <u>proceeds</u> from the Father.
    - The Spirit (is) <u>proceeding</u> from the Father.

- In the genitive:
  - ἀντί, meaning "against", "instead of"
    - Τι ἂν πράξαι <u>ἀντὶ τοῦ εὕδειν</u>;
      - Would you do something <u>instead of sleeping</u>?

- In the dative:
  - ἐν, meaning "in"
    - Τὰ καλὰ <u>ἐν τῷ γίγνεσθαί</u> ἐστιν.
      - Good things are <u>in the making</u>. (lit. "in the becoming")
  - ἐπί, meaning "by" (Dative of Cause)
    - Νοσήσει <u>ἐπὶ τῷ</u> ταῦτ' <u>εἰδέναι</u>.
      - He will suffer <u>by knowing</u> these things.
      - He will suffer <u>because</u> he <u>knows</u> these things.

- In the accusative:
  - πρός, meaning "regards", "concerning", "about"
    - Δεῖ ἡμᾶς συλλαλῆσαι <u>πρὸς τὸ οἰκοδομεῖσθαι</u>.
      - We must converse <u>in regards to the house being built</u>.

## Prepositional

### Ἵνα Clauses

- Ἐργάζομαι, <u>ἵνα ζῇ</u>.
  - I work, <u>so that he may live</u>.
